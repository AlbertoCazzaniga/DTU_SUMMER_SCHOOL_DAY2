# Self Supervised Learning Summer School 2023
## Day 2: On the geometry of self-supervised representations via Intrinsic Dimension and Neighborhood Overlap.

Please find attached slides for the [first](https://github.com/AlbertoCazzaniga/DTU_SUMMER_SCHOOL_DAY2/blob/main/ML_Advanced_School_DAY2_PART1.pdf) and [second](https://github.com/AlbertoCazzaniga/DTU_SUMMER_SCHOOL_DAY2/blob/main/ML_Advanced_School_DAY2_PART2.pdf) part of the lectures on the study of the geometry of self-supervised representations.

The exercise session is based on the [Jupyter Notebook](https://github.com/AlbertoCazzaniga/DTU_SUMMER_SCHOOL_DAY2/blob/main/DTU_SUMMER_SCHOOL_DAY2.ipynb) also available in [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/14zVCiZjLGTpmXp-qv--vE0ZIf0d4yI8t#scrollTo=746DsUFBdRB_) .

We thank Lucrezia Valeriani and Diego Doimo for their help in creating the exercises.

Enjoy!

Alberto and Alessio
